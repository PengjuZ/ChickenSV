SNP and indel calling:

Paired-end 150 bp reads from 354 samples were trimmed and aligned to the WChap1 genome. PCR duplicate removal, read realignment, quality score recalibration, and SNP and Indel calling were performed. Variants were then subjected to quality control using vcftools and GATK with specific filtration criteria for SNPs and indels.
