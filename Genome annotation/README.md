Genome annotation:

Repetitive sequences in the phased assemblies were identified using de novo and homology-based predictions. Coding regions were annotated using annotation liftover, ab initio predictions, RNA expression evidence, and protein homology search. Noncoding RNA annotation was performed using tRNAscan-SE, Infernal, and the Rfam database.
