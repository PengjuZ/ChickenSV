SV calling:

To perform structural variant (SV) calling using Illumina paired-end reads, multiple algorithms such as Read-pair (RP), Split-read (SR), Read depth (RD), and Assembly (AS) can be used. In this study, a combined approach using six detection tools (Manta, Delly, Wham, Smoove, Dysgu, and GRIDSS2) was applied, followed by SV merging using SURVIVOR. The merged SVs were then filtered and refined based on their location with the highest frequency.
