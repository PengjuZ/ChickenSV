SV genotyping:

354 high-depth samples were genotyped using the pan-genome graph. Clean reads were mapped against the graph genome, alignments were filtered, and a compressed coverage index and snarls were generated. SV genotyping results were produced for each sample using "vg call" with specific parameters.
